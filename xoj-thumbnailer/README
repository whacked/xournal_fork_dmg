main.c.patch is a patch that allows you to use xournal as a xoj to pdf 
converter like this:

xournal in.xoj out.pdf

It simply starts xournal normally, but doesn't set the main window to be 
visible.  Then it exports the xoj file to a pdf and exits.

xournal-thumbnailer is a perl script with the same command line 
interface as evince-thumbnailer.  It requires evince-thumbnailer, and 
has been tested with nautilus.

xoj-thumbnailer.schemas is a gconf schema file that will register 
xournal-thumbnailer with the gnome thumbnailing system.

Current limitations:  

Although xournal will not set its main window visible when invoked in 
this manner, it still has to connect to the X server to work. 

Sometimes xournal opens dialog boxes when importing files (such as when 
it cannot find the background pdf).  These dialogs will be displayed 
during command line conversion from xoj to pdf.

I haven't checked the non-english translations in 
xoj-thumbnailer.schemas.  I produced the file by stealing the schemas 
from evince's thumbnailer, and replacing "PDF" with "XOJ".

To install:

After applying the patch, compile and install xournal as normal.  Copy 
xournal-thumbnailer to a directory in your path.  Copy 
xoj-thumbnailer.schemas into your schemas directory, and run these
commands (as root).

$ export GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE=`gconftool-2 --get-default-source`

$ gconftool-2 --makefile-install-rule /usr/share/gconf/schemas/xoj-thumbnailer.schemas

(I really don't know very much about gconf; but these instructions 
worked for me...  I found them at http://www.gnome.org/projects/gconf/ 
under "application developer information")
